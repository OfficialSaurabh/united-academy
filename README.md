## Prerequisites:

- Install git in your machine.
- Have basic command line experiance.
- have knowledge of basic Javascript and Node.js

## Resources to follow to contribute to this project or any open source project

1. Read this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) to open-source contribution.

2. To add the necessary contribution that will get your Pull Request accepeted refer [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/wasim7raja10/utility-tools-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md) file.

## Rules and Regulations

1. Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab

2. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

3. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

4. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

5. To get the digital reward, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.

### Examples of low quailty contributions

- Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

- Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

- Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
